# summary: We develop innovative statistical methodology that leverages structural and biological information in the data. To address the challenges of handling complex-structured data, we develop and employ methods at the interface of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, variable selection, geometric/functional data analysis and spatial statistics.

We develop innovative statistical methodology that leverages structural and biological information in the data. To address the challenges of handling complex-structured data, we develop and employ methods at the interface of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, variable selection, geometric/functional data analysis and spatial statistics.
