title: Statistical methods for the analysis of complex-structured biomedical data
---

We develop innovative statistical methodology that turns the structure in data into signal—explicitly leveraging complexities of data from modern biomedical technologies.

- **Hierarchical Bayesian modeling** to encode domain knowledge and to propagate uncertainty.  
- **Variable selection** to pinpoint a parsimonious set of biomarkers from high‑dimensional feature sets.  
- **Geometric & functional data analysis** to analyze shapes, curves, and trajectories.  
- **Spatial statistics** to exploit spatial dependence in data.
- **Network models in statistics & machine learning** to learn interaction structure and to infuse graph constraints.

Together, these methods provide robust and interpretable inference and prediction—bridging complex structure to clinically meaningful insight while remaining firmly grounded in rigorous statistical principles.
