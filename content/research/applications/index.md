title: Imaging and complex-structured data applications
---

We develop statistical models to:

1.  identify associations between complex-structured data (imaging, spatial-genomic, geospatial, digital) from multi-platform data sources,

2.  predict clinical characteristics of interest by integrating biomarkers generated from complex-structured data, and

3.  understand the biological relevance and implications of our findings.

Our methods are developed in the context of various diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's) diseases.
