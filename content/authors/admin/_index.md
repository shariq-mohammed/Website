I am an *Assistant Professor* in the Department of Biostatistics at Boston University (BU) School of Public Health. I am also a *Rafik B. Hariri Junior Faculty Fellow* at the Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering at BU.

I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Departments of Biostatistics, and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, and a Precision Health Scholar at The University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. I obtained my PhD in Statistics from University of Connecticut.

My research interests include Bayesian modeling, variable selection, geometric functional data analysis, spatial statistics and applications to complex-structured biomedical data. My current research is focused on building statistical methods to address relevant questions in different disease contexts, by integrating complex-structured data (imaging, spatial-genomic, geospatial and digital data) from multiple platforms.
