I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health and a _Rafik B. Hariri Junior Faculty Fellow_ (2022-2025) at BU’s Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering. I build statistical models and computational tools that turn high‑dimensional, complex‑structured data into clinically useful insight.

<!-- Research focus -->
My group develops methods at the interface of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, variable selection, functional & geometric data analysis, spatial statistics, network models. We work with digital, spatial‑omic, geospatial, and imaging data, with applications in neurodegenerative disease (with a focus on dementia and Alzheimer’s disease) and oncology. Our research aims to develop interpretable features, reliable prediction models, and biological explanations that support better decisions in patient and public health.

<!-- Background -->
Before BU, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Biostatistics and in Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, and a Precision Health Scholar. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Connecticut.
